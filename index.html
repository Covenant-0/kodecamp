        <h1>Dear Rodiat,</h1>
        <p>
           I hope this letter finds you well. <br> I am writing to let you know about my recent activities with Kodecamp.
        </p>
        <p>
            Kodecamp has been a very transformative experience fro me. It's more than a coding bootcamp,it's a journey of growth, learning and self-discovery. As I navigate through lines of codes and build projects, I am constantly being reminded of my goals: <br>
            To start with, Kodecamp has taught me the importance of a strong foundation when delving into tech. I want to delve deep into programming concepts. With each challenge, I strive to improve my problem-solving skills which is one of the most crucial skills one must have as a software developer.<br>
            Also, I dream of building web applications and websites that makes a difference. Whether it's a simple landing page or a complex web app, I want users to be happy with it.<br>
            I also aim to collaborate with fellow Kodecampers and learn from their perspective and also contribute to open sourced projects. Connecting with people of like minds is invaluable.<br>
            Ultimately, I want to secure a role as a front-end developer. I believe that at the end of this Kodecamp,I'll be ready to put my skills to test.
        </p>
        <p>
            Dear Rodiat, thank you for being my sounding board and my support in this journey. Your unwavering support fuels my determination. Cheers to celebrating more milestones together!<br>
            Wishing you all the best on all your adventures. I look forward to sharing more stories when next we meet.
